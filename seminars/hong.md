# Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Recent developments in biopharmaceutical manufacturing have created new opportunities for process systems engineering to contribute across upstream and downstream systems. As the industry moves toward digital manufacturing—an integrated, model-centered approach to process design, monitoring, and control—there is a growing need for system-level frameworks that combine mechanistic insight, data analytics, and real-time decision tools. Modern systems engineering methods, including hybrid modeling, high-throughput sensing, optimal experiment design, and advanced control, provide a foundation for representing complex cell-culture dynamics and protein purification behavior in a unified way. This talk will introduce recent efforts to build such frameworks, including hybrid dynamic models that characterize metabolic-phase transitions in CHO cell cultures, model-based experimental design for improving parameter identification under limited data, and state-estimation–assisted predictive control for stable operation in perfusion systems. Complementing these upstream developments, the presentation will also highlight digitalization platforms for downstream protein crystallization, such as droplet-based evaporative screening and automated image-based analysis for estimating crystallization kinetics. Together, these advances demonstrate how physics-informed learning and model-based decision tools can accelerate process development and move biomanufacturing toward predictive, scalable, and increasingly autonomous operation across both upstream and downstream unit operations.
