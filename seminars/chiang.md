# Abstract
<div style="text-align: justify;">
To enhance safety, reliability, and productivity of industrial processes and to accelerate materials discovery, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques have been widely used in process industries for many decades. In the current Industry 4.0 and digital era, AI propels advancement in a wide range of applications in process systems engineering (PSE) including image analytics, large language model (LLM), deep learning, reinforcement learning, hybrid modeling, and real-time analytics.  

As more AI successes are demonstrated in process industries, there is a growing misconception that AI is to replace human decision. The talk will emphasize the need for of Responsible/Trustworthy AI and show industrial examples on how humans and AI must be working in the loop. One aspect is to understand how to incorporate AI methods to assist humans to accelerate discovery in research and to make well-informed decisions in manufacturing operations. The other aspect is to allow humans to incorporate engineering and science domain knowledge to make AI methods smarter. This talk aims to showcase AI success stories in PSE. The discussion will extend to anticipated research paths, the necessity for workforce development, and the imperative collaboration between academia, technology providers, and the industry to further exploit AI's potential.
