Sungho Shin is a Texaco-Mangelsdorf Career Development Chair Assistant Professor of the Chemical Engineering Department at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to joining MIT, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory (supervisor: Mihai Anitescu). He received his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (advisor: Victor M. Zavala). He was a Summer intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory (2020; worked with Carleton Coffrin and Kaarthik Sundar) and Argonne National Laboratory (2018; worked with Mihai Anitescu). He was an undergraduate researcher at Jong Min Lee's group at Seoul National University. His research interests include model predictive control, optimization algorithms, and their applications to large-scale energy infrastructures (such as natural gas and power networks). He is the main developer of the nonlinear optimization solver MadNLP.jl and the automatic differentiation/algebraic modeling tool ExaModels.jl. He was the winner of the W. David Smith, Jr. Graduate Publication Award, AIChE Annual Meeting CAST Directorsâ€™ Student Presentation Award, IFAC ADCHEM Young Author Award, IFAC NMPC Young Author Award. He was a recipient of the Korea Presidential Science Fellowship, Kwanjeong Fellowship, and Grainger Wisconsin Distinguished Graduate Fellowship.
